Hi , welcome to the homebase of Arkin

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Selma de Vries

00:10.000 --> 00:12.498

I am a mental healthworker - 0.13
within the Arkin organisation - 0.15
And as a pick-me-up, I would like to read you a story - 0.20
I think it is  an optimistic story - 0.23
in the past we have used it for easter celebrations - 0.26
in itself this is remarkable - 0.27
as it is an eastern tradition - 0.29
but most universal - 0.31
it's about  being human - 0.33
it's titled , the cracked bucket - 0.36
And I am going to read it to you - 0.38
The Cracked Bucket - 0.40
A water carrier in India had two big buckets - 0.45
that he wore with a yoke on top of his shoulders - 0.48
one of the buckets was whole - 0.52
the other one was cracked on the side  - 0.55
while the first bucket at the end of a long journey
between the river and the masters house
was still entirely full -
the other bucket
had been emptied halfway - 1.06
and this carried on for two years - 1.09
the watercarrier always delivered only one and a half buckets - 1.14
to his masters house - 1.16
and naturally, the solid bucket was most pleased with his performance - 1.20
since it delivered exactly what is was designed for - 1.24
the other cracked bucket was enormously embarassed - 1.30
as a result of his defficiency - 1.32
and he felt dissapointed , that he could perform
only half of the solid bucket - 1.36
for his master the watercarrier
that he was supposed to perform - 1.41
and after getting annoyed over this for two years - 1.46
he felt more and more ill at ease - 1.50
he started to talk to the water carrier down by the river - 1.57
he said to be ashamed off himself and wanted to apoligise to me - 2.01
but why said the watercarier
what are you ashamed for ? - 2.06
i am because i have managed to deliver only one and a half bucket
of water to your master - 2.13
because of the crack in the side of the bucket
i am losing water continously - 2.19
on my way to the masters house - 2.20
and because of my failure to deliver more water - 2.24
you have to work harder and you are not getting
the wages you are supposed to earn - 2.27
the watercarrier began to feel sorry for the old cracked waterbottle
and he said , you know what , if we walk back to the masters house
you should pay attention really well - 2.40
just have a look at those gorgeous flowers by the side of the road - 2.43
walking uphill the cracked bucket saw beautifull flowers indeed
everywhere by the roadside - 2.51
this comforted him a little bit - 2.55
but at the end of the journey he felt unhappy all over again - 3.00
since half of the water had been spilled again - 3.03
again he apoligised to the watercarrier - 3.08
and the watercarrier looked at the bucket and said : - 3.12
havent you noticed that the beautifull flowers only grow
by your side of the road - 3.18
not by the side of the perfect bucket - 3.21
and thats because , i knew al along water was leaking on your side of the road - 3.26
and i taken have advantage of that - 3.29
i have sowed flowerseeds by the side of the road - 3.32
and everytime we return from the river
you water them - 3.37
and this way i have been able to collect beautifull flowers - 3.43
to be able to decorate my masters house - 3.47
if you wouldnt be as you really are - 3.52
than his house wouldnt have been as beautifull as it is - 3.55
that crack wasn't just another crack - 4.03
or it's always more than a crack - 4.07
and i think if there comes a time when we will
all realize eveybody ,that we are not perfect - 4.17
we are not invulnerable, we are not perfect ,
and not everthing is - 4.20
yes cracks are part of it too - 4.24
and we all have that crack 4.28
and is this always bad , and should we always feel inferior
that we might not be perfect - 4.36
i think a whole different thing might be going on - 4.38
Leonard Cohen made a song called Anthem - 4.42
and there is a beautifull sentence in that song - 4.45
a few beautifull sentences - 4.47
there is a crack in everything - 4.51
thats where the light comes in - 4.54
everything and everybody has a crack at some point - 4.59
but because of that crack , light can penetrate - 5.03
i think if you have known that you are not perfect
for a while by now , by no means you are done - 5.11
on the contrary , it can lead to something beautifull - 5.16
in this case of the bucket story - 5.20
the beauty is in the flowers that flourish by the roadside - 5.24
but i believe that all of us , with our tiny crack(s) - 5.30
and everything that comes with it ,
we still can mean the world to each other - 5.33
so my wish is that through every crack ,
light will be able to shine through - 5.37
and that this light will keep us upright with each other - 5.42
in any case , let us not be ashamed by a crack , but walk the extra mile
for the other person - 5.48
i wish you the good , a good day , a good beginning , - 5.52
if look in the morning or a very good evening - 5.57
that we can look at ourselves with mildness - 5.59
untill next time 06.01
