Hi , Welcome to the "ThuisBuis" by Arkin.

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.320
How nice of you to watch this video .

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.200 
My name is Selma de Vries 

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.640
I'm a mental healthworker
within a number of departments of the Arkin organisation.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
And as a heartbooster, 
I would like to read you a story.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.720
I think it is an optimistic story.

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920
In the past we have used it for easter celebrations ,
in itself this is remarkable ,

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.160
since it is an eastern tradition ,

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.440
But most universal .

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.160
It's about being human.

11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.160
It's titled the cracked bucket.

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.800
And I'm going to read it to you.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.160
A water-carrier in India had two big buckets, 
on both sides of the yoke.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.560
That he wore on a yoke on top of his shoulders
One of the buckets was whole,

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.960
while the one was cracked on the side.

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.520
So while that second bucket at he end

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
of the long road between the river and the house of the master
of this water carrier 

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.280
still was filled to the brim with water ,
the other bucket was half empty

19
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.520
And this carried on like this for two full years .

20
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.640
the watercarrier delivered always only

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880
one and a half bucket to his masters house .

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.800
And of course the full bucket was most proud of his performance ,
since he knows 

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.920
exactly what is was made for.

24
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
That other poor cracked bucket ,

25
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.480
was hugely embarresed

26
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.360
about its defficiency.

27
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.800
and he felt miserable that he could only perform half , 

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800
for his own master , the watercarrier ,

29
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.200
than what he actually was supposed to do.

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.000
and after having annoyed himself over this , 
and ever more ,

31
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.720
started feeling bad about himself ,
felt really bad , started 

32
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.880
to talk spontanously to the watercarrier by the river.

33
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.800
he said , i am embarresed and I want to apoligise to you.

34
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.920
But why said the watercarrier ?

35
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
Why are you ashamed ?

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.160
I am because during de last two years , 

37
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.320
i have managed to deliver only half a bucket
of water to your master .

38
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.480
because of the crack in the side of the bucket ,
i am losing water continously 
on the way to my masters house .

39
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.080
and because of my failure to deliver more water 
you have to work harder and surely you are not getting

40
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.760
the wages you are supposed to earn .

41
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.880
The watercarrier began to feel sorry for the old cracked waterbottle

42
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.920
and he said , you know what , if we go back to the masters house
in a little while ,

43
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.720
you should pay attention really well .

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.640
JUst have a look at the beautifull flowers by the side of the road.

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.840
And indeed as they walked up the hill,

46
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.040
the cracked bucket saw beautiful wild flowers indeed

47
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.160
everywhere by the roadside This comforted him a little bit.

48
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920
but at the end of the journey he felt unhappy all over again

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.480
since half of the water had been spilled again.

50
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.520
Again he apoligised to the watercarrier.

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.560
and the watercarrier looked at he bucket and said :

52
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.920
hay listen , havent you noticed that the beautifull flowers only grow

53
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.160
by your side of the road ?

54
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.680
Not by the side of the perfect bucket.

55
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.760
and thats because , i knew all along water was leaking on your side of the road.

56
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.640
and i have taken advantage of that.

57
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.280
i have sown flowerseeds by the side of the river

58
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.400
and everytime we return from the river
you water them.

59
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.920
and this way i have been able to collect beautifull flowers
for two years 

60
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.720
to be able to decorate my masters house .

61
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.800
If you wouldnt be the way you really are 

62
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.720
than this house wouldnt have been a beautifull as it is.

63
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.000
that crack wasn't just another crack
or it's always more than a crack.

64
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.920
and i think if there comes a time when we will.

65
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.760
all realise .

66
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.640
that we are not perfect.

67
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.040
We are not invulerable , and we are not perfect.

68
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.760
yes cracks are part of it too ,
and we all have them.

69
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680
and is this always bad , 

70
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.560
and should we always feel inferior 
because they may not be perfect?

71
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.560
I think a whole different thing might be going on.

72
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.880
Leonard Cohen made a song called Anthem

73
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.560
and there  is a beautifull sentence in that song.

74
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.000
a few beautifull sentences actually.

75
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.560
there's a crack in everything

76
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.320
yet again he states : There is a crack in everything

77
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.800
thats where the light comes in

78
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.880
everything and eveybody has a crack at some point in time.

79
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.200
Or isnt perfect.

80
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.320
But because of that crack
light can penetrate.

81
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.200
I think if you have known for a longer time , that you are not perfect.

82
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.600
by no means , you are done .

83
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.320
on the contrary , you can utilize it

84
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.920
It can lead to something beautifull

85
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.480
In this case of the bucket story

86
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.360
the beauty is in the flowers 

87
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.920
that flourish by the roadside.

88
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.360
but i think that all of us , with our tiny crack(s)

89
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.600
and everything that comes with it 
we still can mean the world to each other.

90
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.080
So my wish is that through evey crack ,.

91
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.920
light will be able to shine through

92
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.360
and that this light will keep us upright with each other.

93
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.640
In any case , 

94
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.600
let us not be ashamed by a crack , but walk
the extra mile for the other person.

95
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.360
i wish you the best , .

96
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.080
a good day , a good beginning .

97
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.960
if you look in the morning ,

98
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.680
or a very good evening 
99
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.28
that we can look at ourselves with mildness.

100
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.320
untill next time !
