00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.280
Hi!

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.080
good day , nice of you
to watch the home tube ofArkin

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.480
My name is Selma de Vries

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.040
I a, a mental caretaker 

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
on a number of wards, among others for Mentrum, 
Inforsa and Jellinek 

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.720
As a mental caretaker,
we talk about life 

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.200
And also about what keeps
us going

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
Especially what keeps us going 
in difficult times

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.640
and, many people find support
on through all sorts of faith

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000.
Me too , uh , through all sorts 
of traditions 

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.960
and today i wanted to something
about 

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.080
Pentecost and still about
another image that goes with
that in my view 

13
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.600
But first about pentecost

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.320
Pentecost is a less well known 
celebration perhaps

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.040
fortunately we are off two 
days from work

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.680
Why is that ?

17
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.920
Pentecost is part of the passion
of Christ

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
The story of his folks that
he has lived , 2000 years ago

19
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.120
people in the christian 
tradition know this

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.440
Uhm, for those less familiair
with it 

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.960
There are some beautifull images 
that may be comfort for
every human being

22
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.000
It is a story of loneliness ,
great faith and love

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.320

24
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.120
loneliness in the battle

25
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.960
Jezus agony 

26
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.640
On good friday he dies on the cross

27
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.720
Uhm, with pentecost we celebrate
the ressurection from the grave

28
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.080
Death is not the end

29
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.680
The suffering is not the last
word in 

30
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.840
this world , but the story
doesnt stop here just yet 

31
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.680
Jezus euh, is still present for 
forty days on this earth , according tradition

32
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.760
Such a nice round number
a symbolical number too

33
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.840
He still has contact with  his
friends , the most loyal people
that he 

34
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.400
still wanted to reveal 
the majority of his message to

35
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
The message of love and that everbody
is included , inclusion

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.400

37
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.400
eventually he says goodbye
to his friends

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120
On ascension day

39
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840
That was last thursday

40
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.560
Nice to be making this video
while it is

41
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.600
Pentecost is the first pentecost day

42
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
and pentecost is the celebration
of the outpouring of the
holy spirit

43
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.440
Jesus has been taken up in heaven 

44
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.480
and he stated I will not6 leave you
behind as orphans

45
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.320
you dont stay on earth by yourself

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.600
And i think that you
say to all of us

47
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
maybe if you might believe that

48
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000
We are having a hard time
on our own , and the

49
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.600
idea that something of god`s love
is present

50
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.560
that we celebrate with Pentecost , 
pentecost

51
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
THe story that his euh, friends

52
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.400
a bit frightened closed with
each other 

53
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.880
sit in a house , since they
are scared of the protests 

54
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.080
Many people have been crtical towards Jesus 
and therefor also towards them 

55
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040
Euh, so they dont feel safe

56
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.400
And then something happens 

57
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.480
than they hear a wind 

58
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.880
everything has been locked up
, but still there is a strong 
wind blowing in the room 
where they are seated

59
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.680
They see fire , wind and fire.

60
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.120
Than you have to pay attention there
though

61
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.520
There is something divine
going on 

62
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.240
And this is the story of the
outpouring

63
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.960
of the holy spirit , that
is manifested in wind and fire 

64
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.360
than something extaordinary
happens 

65
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.360
The disciples , simpel folks ,

66
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.840
the Israel at that time 
fishermen of

67
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.720
all sorts of backgrounds 

68
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.880
The moment that this story
unfolds

69
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.760
Uh, it is very busy in Jeruzalem

70
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.120
People from all over the world
Jews from all over the world

71
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.720
The then known world gathered
in Jerusalem and after that 
outpouring of the

72
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.960
Holy spirit , they are filled
with zeal and the faith , with fire

73
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.680
they feel the love 
in their bones

74
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.240
I imagine as such , and they
take it to the streets

75
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.120
And they are going to
tell Jesus s story

76
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.880
And there is something exeptional
going on

77
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.920
Suddenly , these people can 
speak various languages

78
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.320
So all those strangers in Jerusalem
heard

79
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.240
Jesus s story again in their own language 

80
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.480
Now you can think ,

81
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.960
Nice story

82
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.840
Strange too , there must be something
there , and that 

83
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.920
people thought too at the time
but they are probably drunk

84
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.680
Its still noon but probably

85
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.480
something got missing ?

86
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.360
Maybe out of sorrow

87
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.400
But that cant be

88
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.960
But is a story of faith and 
its want to clarify something ,
i guess

89
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.800

90
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.360
that we can understand
each other for real

91
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.240
Even if we derive from
several parts of the world

92
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.840
So euh, its more than speaking 
each others language ,
its about full understanding 
mutually

93
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.600
Thats a whole different thing
altogether

94
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160
And that is uhm

95
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.760
The story of pentecost
thats the holy spirit

96
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
And I dont know
Euh

97
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.480
I hope everyone had at least 
once the  

98
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.800
experience , that you fullly
understood someone at once 

99
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.040
Or the feeling that you
actually were

100
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.080
seen by the other one opposite of you

101
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.560
at such a moment you actually
comprehend each other ,
which feels like heaven sent

102
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.320
In this Covid era , we probably felt
a strong 

103
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.120
urge to be understood by anyone

104
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.240
There are an incredible amount 
of people 

105
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.520
having tried , fortunately , to shape 

106
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.280
how connected you can feel ,
how you can serve each other mutually

107
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200
Even though the fact that you
need to remain indoors

108
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.320
with your fear , maybe with 
your gloom or your confusion

109
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.360
Uhm, and that they still found
ways to connected

110
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.040
That I find still a little piece

111
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.000
of Pentecost , that you attempt
to gather and connect

112
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.840

113
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.960
Connected , since you are human
and that we all belong together
at some point?

114
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.320

115
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.600
That idea that we are one 
even though we dont always
fully undertand each other

116
00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.320
And then you need divine
intervention at times , to
really connect and understand 

117
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.480
And sometimes it takes simply
effort from our side 

118
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.280
at times , we dont understand 
each other , and people do 

119
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.080
things , or make choices 
that you ,

120
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.960
at first , dont understand
that well

121
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.400
But if you'd really know the other
one , if so to speak ,

122
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.800
Euh, you had walked along the other
one's side ,

123
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.480
Actually had walked in his / her foot steps,

124
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.160
Then you comprehend much better ,
why people make 

125
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360
the choices they make 

126
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.880
I feel that my choices too
cant always 

127
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.480
be understood clearly , and
you try to explain

128
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.520
You are getting closer to
each other , so sometimes 

129
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.560
that takes ome effort , and
other times it costs huge effort
to understand each other

130
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.920
But if you start from the 
startingpoint that we are 
all human , and 

131
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.240
all humans belong 
regardless the way we are , 
with some effort

132
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.680
we can really comprehend each other

133
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.960
Thats what Pentecost stands for.
and I still have an image of that

134
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.400
From a totally different tradition

135
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.680
Thats the tradition , the budhist
tradition , and its a depiction 

136
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.400
Its an art depiction of the
work of Indra 

137
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.280
I'm gonna display it
in a minute 

138
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.520
Yes , thats alwaysnaturally
hard 

139
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.120
I am not that technically
inclined 

140
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.840
I am not sure if you can see it 

141
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.600
You actually see

142
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.760
from left to right , from the top
to the bottom , you see pearls 

143
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.320
balls being interconnected 
and they are connected to each other 

144
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.760
You just have to take it from me 

145
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.520
The Indra web is a

146
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.600
derives from ancent tale from
the budhist tradition , and the 
vedic god Indra 

147
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.360
That has a web all across the world 

148
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.040
It stretches itself out in all
dimensions , so not only what we
can see , but

149
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.800
maybe from the part , we can not
see whatsoever 

150
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.280
And on every node of the web
there is a litle ball

151
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.160
A pearl !
So the story tells us

152
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.640
you can see it quite nicely
if you have a think , actually,

153
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.480
about a spiderweb , where all 
the nodes have dawn droplets

154
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.120
there is a little ball euh

155
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.400
Moisture

156
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.080
So Indra's web consists of countless
little balls

157
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.320
In some languages they are
colaaed tears

158
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.680
And all those tears , those balls
reflect the other ones

159
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.200
And that perpetuates in infinity

160
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.440
Each ball is therefor ultimately
connected

161
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.520
with all those other countless
thousend tears or pearls

162
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.840
I love to picture that

163
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.600
Look it up , if you will

164
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
If you like it , the web of Indra

165
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.960
Its such a beatifull image that we all

166
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.560
are connected , even we cant grasp 
it rationally

167
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.840
But i find it 

168
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.600
We are all interconnected

169
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.320
Our actions also affect eveyone

170
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.440
So contemplate please how big

171
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.600
the effect will be of good ,
of good things 

172
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.200
That continues to work , than you
probably cna imagine

173
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.080
But we all belong.

174
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.920
We all have our unique spot 
 in that web and we try as best we can

175
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.240
to figure out what exactly our role
entails

176
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.480
But the same liitle ball as
everyone else

177
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.960
Nobody needs to feel special

178
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.120
We all have our spot in that endless
stretched out Indra web

179
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.600
That I find stiil also an image

180
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.320
of Daas , that entire story of 
connection of pentecost 

181
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.280
We can comprehend each other

182
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.200
We are on a deep level very deep
connected with each other

183
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.760
That era i really loved

184
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.800
Euh, also in the recent past
corona measures decreased 

185
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.240
That we will interconect
again for sure

186
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.560
and i hope that we will never
forget

187
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.720
howmuch we crave for real 
connection with each other

188
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.760
Euh, I am convinced that we are

189
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.200
I am wishing you very
good coming weeks , maybe

190
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.680
this video will be added far
after pentecost ?

191
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.560
No idea

192
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.360

193
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.960
But is wish you all a great time
in connection

194
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.320
And that we sometimes can feel just
that with more or less effort

195
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.480
All this next time
